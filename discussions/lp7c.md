12. Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:



I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces
that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras
— families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It
claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that
everything is an object is saying nothing at all.
